# yikers
A Discord Bot that counts the number of times the word "Yikes" is said in a channel.

## Note: Do not use this as a template for your projects. No realistic security measures implemented.

Realistically, this might be the worst code you've ever seen given this was made as a side-project / joke between a group of friends and me before I took on computer science, and as such, has no scalability whatsoever in its current state. No other channels are checked, and all other words are deleted in order to keep the "Yikes-Train" going. The current number of instances is tracked in the number.txt file, and there is a command to iterate through all instances to verify that a user editing their message later on gets detected, adjusting the number accordingly.

I probably should delete this, but hey, it shows where I'm starting from (and gave me an appreciation for good documentation).
